# Starting The Project Locally

- `git clone` or `git pull` according to if you're starting your local from scratch or just updating.
- In the base directory, run `npm install`. (It is helpful to temporarily disable antivirus since some team members have encountered it blocking crucial package files from downloading.)
- `cd client/ & npm install` again in that sub-directory. There may be depreciation warnings but all dependencies are currently intact as of March 23, 2021.
- `cd ..` to go back the base directory and run `npm build`. Wait for the build to complete, then run `npm run dev` to start the development client.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser with console or wait for it to launch automatically after building. Port 8080 is the "live" version and will not reflect changes yet.
- `Ctrl + C` or `Commmand key + C` to end the development server.

### Thanks for using our app!
